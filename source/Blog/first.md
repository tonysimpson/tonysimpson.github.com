Title: First!
Catagory: Blog

Ok lets get this show on the road! I'd better think about what I should post; given I work for a test company probably something about that:

*   How the marketing/good ideas ratio in test tools is way too high
*   Maybe a look at some of the cool tool's we are and have developed inhouse
*   The weird things which happen when you give functional testers tools like SoapUI and expect them to become more productive

Probably some raving about the things I really love:

*   Debian
*   Python and its fantastic libraries
*   Getting the most done for the minimal effort

And other stuff I guess.
